        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <div class="intro">
            Jack of all trades, master of some (maybe?). Solid state physicist
            by training, software developer by trade, and student by nature. I've
            always been fascinated by the way things work, and I dedicated my
            educational career to understanding "how". Now, I've taken that curiousity
            and pointed it towards building tools to solve interesting problems,
            and hopefully make the world a better place.
