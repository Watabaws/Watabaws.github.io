                    Hi! I'm Adam. I'm an undergraduate student studying Materials Science, with a wide variety of interdisciplinary interests. From a young age, I've been fascinated with how everything works - whether it was something as simple as a pen or a watch, or the fundamental laws of the universe. As a 15 year old, I co-founded my first company: Kinet-X, a project-based learning program that aimed to bring reasonable STEM education to students as young as 9, and as old as 17. In my role as Director of Programming, I personally developed curriculum for all of our CS classes, and managed a team of student teachers in educating everything from basic web development, to advanced software development. In April of 2017, Kinet-X made it into the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyc-high-school-students-expand-tech-camp-1492126069">Wall Street Journal!</a> I currently attend the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where I'm involved in student government, work as an Undergraduate Researcher in the <a href="https://www.epitaxy.caltech.edu">Falson Group</a>, and hold a part-time internship at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Psyche mission. I love learning new things, and my interests include STEM education, quantum and topological materials, computer science, and engineering. Feel free to check out some of my writings and projects, or to shoot me an email with questions (or just to chat)!
