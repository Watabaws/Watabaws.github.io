                    When I was 15, I co-founded my first company: Kinet-X. Our mission is to bring STEM education to students that would otherwise not have access to it. Since our first program, we've reached over a thousand students, created numerous programs and been featured in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyc-high-school-students-expand-tech-camp-1492126069">Wall Street Journal</a>.

                    After spending a majority of my childhood overweight, I started moving towards a healthier lifestyle in my sophomore year of high school. I lost almost 40 pounds over the following 3 years, as well as putting on a sizable amount of muscle mass. I joined, and became captain of, my school's wrestling team, and started writing my own workout plans and micromanaging my meal plans. I also do my best to help my friends and family out when they're trying to change their lifestyle!
